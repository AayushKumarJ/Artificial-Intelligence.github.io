Chess-playing computers, Self-driving cars, Personal Digital Assistance Apps, Flying Drones, Voice recognition apps these are all popular technological - breakthroughs today. Unlike regular computer programs, where machines only follow programming instructions, these applications use various technological tools to learn and make decisions on their own. This ability of machines to think and learn on their own is called Artificial Intelligence.

Intelligence, according to the Oxford dictionary, is defined as the ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills.

Al (Artificial Intelligence) is the simulation of human intelligence  processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

The field of Al was founded in 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, USA, where the term "Artificial intelligence" was coined by a Stanford researcher John McCarthy. Computer scientists have been syste working on Al for decades.
