There’s no right or wrong way to get into AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them. We can start with learning programming languages like python and spider or by studying calculus and statistics.You can even begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.AI is fascinating because they meet at the intersection of all of these.The more you learn, it becomes more exciting.
