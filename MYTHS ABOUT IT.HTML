1.AI is going to replace all jobs
</u></font><FONT FACE="arial black" SIZE=4 COLOR="green"><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It’s certainly true that the advent of AI and automation has the potential to seriously disrupt labour – and in many situations it is already doing just that. However, seeing this as a straightforward transfer of labour from humans to machines is a vast over-simplification.AI technology as only a method to work in newer and smarter ways.<br><br>

2.Only low-skilled and manual workers will be replaced by AI and automation
</u></font><FONT FACE="arial black" SIZE=4 COLOR="green"><br>

</u></font><FONT FACE="arial black" SIZE=4 COLOR="green">
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn reality intelligence is measured in many different dimensions. In some of them (for example speed of calculations or capacity for recall) computers already far outpace us, while in others, such as creative ability, emotional intelligence (such as empathy) and strategic thinking, they are still nowhere near and aren’t likely to be any time soon.</font>
