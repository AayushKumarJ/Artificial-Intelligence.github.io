1. HIGH COST OF IMPLEMENTATION<br></u></font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=6 color="blue">
Setting up AI-based machines, computers, etc. entails huge costs given the complexity of engineering that goes into building one. Further, the astronomical expense doesn’t stop there as repair and maintenance also run into thousands of dollars.<br><br>
</font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=10 color="red"><u>
2. CAN’T REPLACE HUMANS<br></u></font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=6 color="blue">
It is beyond any doubt that machines perform much more efficiently as compared to a human being. But even then it is practically impossible to replace humans with AIs, at least in the near future, because you can’t build human intelligence in a machine as it is a gift of nature. So, no matter how smart a machine can become, it can never replace a human.<br><br>

3. DOESN’T IMPROVE WITH EXPERIENCE<br></u></font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=6 color="blue">
One of the most amazing characteristics of human cognitive power is its ability to develop with age and experience. However, the same can’t be said about AIs as they are machines that can’t improve with experience, rather it starts to wear and tear with time.<br><br>

<font face="monotype corsiva" size=10 color="red"><u>
4. LACKS CREATIVITY<br></u></font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=6 color="blue">
AIs are not built for creative pieces of work.Although they can help you in designing and creating something special, they still can’t compete with the human brain. Their creativity is limited to the creative ability of the person who programs and commands them.<br><br>
</font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=10 color="red"><u>
5. RISK OF UNEMPLOYMENT<br></u></font>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=6 color="blue">
With rapid development being made in the field of AI, the question that plagues our intuitive brain is that – will AI replace humans? Honestly,its not sure whether AIs will lead to higher unemployment or not. But AIs are likely to take over the majority of the repetitive tasks, which are largely binary in nature and involve minimum subjectivity.</font>
