AI(Artificial Intelligence)systems work by combining large sets of data with intelligent, iterative processing algorithms to learn from patterns and features in the data that they analyze.

Each time an AI system runs a round of data processing, it tests and measures its own performance and develops additional expertise.

Because AI never needs a break, it can run through hundreds, thousands, or even millions of tasks extremely quickly, learning a great deal in very little time, and becoming extremely capable at whatever it’s being trained to accomplish.

But the trick to understanding how AI truly works is understanding the idea that AI isn’t just a single computer program or application, but an entire discipline, or a science.

The goal of AI science is to build a computer system that is capable of modeling human behavior so that it can use human-like thinking processes to solve complex problems.

To accomplish this objective, AI systems utilize a whole series of techniques and processes, as well as a vast array of different technologies.

By looking at these techniques and technologies, we can begin to really understand what AI actually does, and thus, how it works, so let’s take a look at those next.
